########## REQUIREMENTS #################

Develop and establish dataflow methodologies. Data acquired from generic sensors to 
visualization of live processed data on dashboard at a minimum sampling rate of 5Hz. 
The flow requires that data is routed from the sensor to the cloud where bespoke data 
processing methods (e.g. data smoothing) can be applied before rendering live on the 
dashboard by calculating 60 second moving average. Basic statistical analysis e.g. 
ANOVA. Assess, report and formulate methods of improving any time delays between 
acquisition and visualization on the dashboard, with a latency of less than 5s 
for raw data and less than 10s-60s for processed data depending on complexity of data manipulation.
