########## REQUIREMENTS #################

Application Programming Interface (API) to read data from equipment, 
demonstrate real-time data monitoring, with a latency of less than 5 seconds, 
from IoT enabled sensors. Work towards the GMP validation of the API by carrying out the appropriate characterisation, qualification steps. 
For this, a GMP software validation expert will be consulted to guide the work towards testing and validating the data flows, 
validating the software against the user, and validating 
the software against security issues. This will help to obtain the Installation Qualification (IQ), 
Operational Qualification (OQ) and Performance Qualification (PQ).
